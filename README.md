# directory

*directory* is an experimental resource list that gathers lectures, meetups, organizations, zines, books, videos, pdfs, and people who engage with technology, art, activism, and theory in overlapping and myriad ways. it started out as a mental mind map by lizz thabet who found she was often sharing resources and connecting people across disciplines.
